Ad-hoc autoloading components used by PocketMine-MP

⚠️ **This package is now abandoned. Its components were only useful to [pmmp/PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP), and as such, they have been [merged into PocketMine-MP 5.0.0-BETA4](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/4aba9d9725f63b4708a8f04ac3c8c2e222377f74) for easier maintenance.**

This package was originally part of the also-abandoned [pocketmine/spl](https://github.com/pmmp/SPL) package, which was used by both [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) and [RakLib](https://github.com/pmmp/RakLib) in years past. However, since RakLib no longer depends on any thread-related stuff, this package is doing nothing useful by itself, spamming Dependabot notifications and adding extra wasted time to core maintenance.
